# provider_tracker
Hours and location tracker for homecare providers in the field.

## Problem Statement

In my previous job as a case coordinator at the Illinois Department of Rehabilition Services (DRS), part of my job was to monitor the hours and location of personal assistants(also referred to as "providers") who helped my clients with their daily tasks at home.  For my capstone I would like to write a fieldworker tracking software that would be better suited for the needs of low income DRS clients and providers.

* providers called into a automated operator and had to go through up to ten steps of entering ID number, client case numbers, and choosing menu items to clock in and out.  There was no feedback if they entered their information incorrectly.  Providers who repeatedly and unknowingly entered the wrong information were at risk of being terminated for fraud.

* The system required the client to have a landline telephone as a means to identify that the provider was as the client's home.  All of our clients lived below the poverty line, and very few had reliable phone service.  Most depended on the use of government sponsored cell phones with less than 250 minutes per month.
